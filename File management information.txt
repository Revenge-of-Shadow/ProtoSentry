"Audiofiles" directory is meant to be extracted to the SD card. That is, WAVe files must be in the root directory of the card.
PS_Primary_board.ino is to be uploaded on the primary Arduino board.
PS_Secondary_board.ino is to be uploaded on the secondary Arduino board.

I refuse to add the whole project pinout anytime soon.
