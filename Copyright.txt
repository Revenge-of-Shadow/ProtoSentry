Sentry sound files were made by Valve. 
"Frontier Justice" track was written by Dapper Dog and distorted by YouTube user "". No, seriously, that is the displayed name of the YouTube user.

I claim no copyright claims... yes, I could have said it better.
Sorry if I sell the Sentry model, though. It is not like [drawings/figurines/plush toys] of Valve characters are not sold as black market merchandise.
